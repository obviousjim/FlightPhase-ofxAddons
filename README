These openFrameworks addons were created for interactive motion graphics projects and 
are hopefully reusable.

They are released under the MIT license and can be used for whatever you want.

If you improve or extend them, please consider sending it back our way!

ofxImageSequence
/// ************************************
This addon is for loading a series of image files
and accessing them like you would frames of a movie.
 
This class loads only textures to the graphics card and does not store pixel data in memory. This helps with
fast, random access drawing of sequences without too much memory overhead.

Why would you use this instead of a movie file? A few reasons,

 * If you want truly random frame access with no lag on large images, ofxImageSequence allows it

 * If you need a movie with alpha channel the only readily available codec 
	is Animation (PNG) which is slow at large resolutions, so this class can help with that
	
 * If you want to easily access frames based on percents this class makes that easy


ofxQTKitVideoGrabber
/// ************************************
This addon replaces the functionality of the standard ofVideoGrabber
but uses the QTKit Objective-C Libraries to drive the video display.
These libraries are naturally GPU enabled, multi-threaded, as well
as supporting more Quicktime capture codecs such as HDV.

You will need to add the QTKit.framework and CoreVideo.framework
to the openFrameworks Xcode project

Requires Mac OS 10.5 or greater

ofxQTKitVideoPlayer
/// ************************************
Replaces the functionality of the standard ofVideoPlayer
using the QTKit Objective-C Libraries. Should be considerably faster
for big videos.

This addon has been following me around for the last year and has been
useful in a number of different projects with the Rockwell Group LAB (http://lab.rockwellgroup.com)
and FlightPhase (http://www.flightphase.com)

Special Thanks to Marek Bereza for his initial ofxQTKitVideoTexture
http://www.mrkbrz.com/ which i borrowed some code from

and also thanks to Anton Marini for help wrangling buffer contexts.

You will need to add the QTKit.framework and CoreVideo.framework
to the openFrameworks Xcode project

ofxProjectorBlend
/// ************************************
This class is an openFrameworks wrapper for this technique:
from http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/texture_colour/edgeblend/
Original Core Image filter converted to openFrameworks via a GLSL shader

Originally used in the Infiniti MOI project for projector blending ( http://vimeo.com/14588336 )

This shader is capable of blending multiple projections on all sides, but ofxProjectorBlend currently
just uses the shader for two projections at once.

ofxTSPSReceiver
/// ************************************
This addon is a wrapper for receiving openTSPS (http://www.opentsps.com) People Tracking data
in a separate openFrameworks project.  This is useful for quickly prototyping interactive
designs without having to add all the computer vision code to your oF
project.

For another example of a project using this addon, check out the sourcecode from workshop
flightphase participated in during Open/Public Lab in September 2010:
https://github.com/obviousjim/OpenPublicWorkshop

For this example to work you must be running an instance of OpenTSPS configured
to send OSC data to this IP on port 12000

ofxAlphaMaskShader
/// ************************************
Not really an add on, but an example of how to use a shader to use one
image as the alpha channel of another, much like an image mask in photoshop/
